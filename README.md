### Day 1-5: Introduction to C++ and Basic Syntax

**Day 1: Introduction to C++**
- Overview of C++
- History and evolution
- Setting up the environment (IDEs like Visual Studio, CLion)
- First "Hello, World!" program

**Day 2: Basic Syntax**
- Variables (int, float, char)
- Data types
- Operators (+, -, \*, /)

**Day 3: Control Structures - Conditional Statements**
- If/else statements
- Switch statements

**Day 4: Control Structures - Loops**
- For loops
- While loops
- Do while loops

**Day 5: Functions in C++**

- Function arguments and return types

### Day 6-10: Arrays, Vectors, Strings

**Day 6: Arrays in C++**
- Declaring arrays
- Accessing array elements
Basic operations with arrays (sorting)

**Day 7: Vectors in C++ (STL)**
Introduction to vectors:
    - Creating vectors (`std::vector`)
    - Adding elements (`push_back`, `insert`)
    - Accessing vector elements (`at`, `operator[]`)

**Day 8: Strings in C++**
Introduction to strings:
    - Creating strings (`std::string`)
    - String operations (`+`, `+=`, etc.)
    Basic string manipulation methods (`find`, `replace`)

**Day 9: Multidimensional Arrays and Matrices**
Creating multidimensional arrays:
    Handling matrices with nested loops.

**Day 10: Practice Problems on Arrays/Vectors/Strings**

### Day 11–15 Object-Oriented Programming Basics

#### **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**

*   **Class & Objects**: Defining classes; creating objects.
*   **Constructors & Destructors**: Understanding constructors for initialization; destructors for cleanup.
*   **Access Modifiers**: Public vs. Private vs. Protected members.

#### Specific Days:

*   **Day11:** Classes & Objects  
        * Define a simple class  
        * Create objects from the class  

*   **Day12:** Constructors & Destructors  
        * Constructor syntax  
        * Destructor usage  

*   **Day13:** Access Modifiers  
        * Public access modifier examples  
        * Private access modifier examples  

*   **14:** Inheritance Basics   
      Inheriting properties from one class into another.

      Example of single inheritance.

      Understanding protected members during inheritance.

#### Practice Exercises on OOP Concepts:

#### Day15:
Practice exercises involving classes with constructors/destructors/access modifiers/inheritance concepts. Implement real-world scenarios using these OOP principles.


### Day16–20 Advanced Topics in Object-Oriented Programming


#### Advanced OOP Topics


1. Polymorphism 
2. Operator Overloading 
3. Templates 

Specific Days:


1\. Polymorphism – Method Overriding/Overloading


\*\*

\*\*

\*\*

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be treated as if they were of the same type.


Example code demonstrating method overriding using virtual functions.



2\. Operator Overloading



Customizing operators like + or << for user-defined data types.



Implement operator overloading within a custom class.



3\. Templates – Generic Programming



Using templates to create generic functions or classes that can work with any data type without needing explicit casting.



Example code showing template usage for both function templates and class templates.



Days Dedicated to Each Topic:

\-day16:\ Polymorphism Examples\
\-day17:\ Operator Overloading\
\-day18:\ Template Basics\
\-day19:\ Advanced Template Techniques\
\-day20:\ Practice Problems on Advanced OOP Topics



Practice exercises combining polymorphism/operator overloading/templates concepts into comprehensive projects.


### Day21–25 File Input/Output & Exception Handling


File I/O Operations:


Reading/Writing Text Files (.txt)


Reading/Writing Binary Files (.bin)


Exception Handling Mechanisms:


Try/Catch Blocks


Throw Keyword Usage


Days Dedicated:


day21:\ Reading Text Files (.txt)\
day22:\ Writing Text Files (.txt)\
day23:\ Reading/Writing Binary Files (.bin)\
day24:\ Exception Handling Fundamentals\
day25:\ Practical Exercises on File I/O Exceptions



Implement file handling tasks combined with error handling techniques using try/catch blocks.


### Day26–30 Final Projects & Review Sessions


Final Project Development Days:

Develop comprehensive projects incorporating all learned concepts such as data structures/algorithms/OOP/file handling/error management/etc., into real-world applications like games/calculators/chatbots/etc., depending on interest level/skill set/time available.


Review Sessions:

Spend time reviewing key concepts covered throughout the course focusing particularly on areas where improvement is needed based on feedback/practice results/test scores etc., ensuring solid foundational understanding before moving forward beyond this beginner’s course scope.


Final Assessment/Test Preparation:



Prepare students for potential assessments/tests by practicing past exams/sample questions/review quizzes covering major topics discussed during these thirty days ensuring readiness/confidence when facing actual evaluations later down line whether academic/professional settings alike!
